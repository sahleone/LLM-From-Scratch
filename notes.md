### Transformer Model Components Overview

#### **`Head` Class:**
- **Purpose:** Implements a single self-attention head, crucial for calculating attention scores between different time steps in the input sequence.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Initialization:** Sets up linear layers for keys, queries, and values, as well as a triangular matrix for masking future time steps and a dropout layer for regularization.
  - **Forward Pass:** Transforms inputs into key, query, and value vectors, computes attention scores, applies masking, and performs weighted aggregation.

#### **`MultiHeadAttention` Class:**
- **Purpose:** Runs multiple self-attention heads in parallel, allowing the model to capture different relationships within the input data simultaneously.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Initialization:** Initializes multiple `Head` instances and a projection layer to combine their outputs.
  - **Forward Pass:** Concatenates the outputs from all attention heads, projects the combined result back to the original embedding size, and applies dropout.

#### **`FeedForward` Class:**
- **Purpose:** Implements a simple feedforward neural network used within transformer blocks to add non-linearity and process the output of the self-attention mechanism.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Initialization:** Defines a two-layer network that expands and contracts the embedding size, with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
  - **Forward Pass:** Passes the input through the feedforward network layers and returns the output.

#### **`Block` Class:**
- **Purpose:** Represents a single transformer block, combining multi-head self-attention with a feedforward neural network, layer normalization, and residual connections.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Initialization:** Sets up components for multi-head attention, feedforward processing, and layer normalization.
  - **Forward Pass:** Applies self-attention, normalization, and feedforward processing, with residual connections to stabilize and improve training.

### **GPT Language Model (`GPTLanguageModel` Class):**
- **Purpose:** Encapsulates the architecture of a GPT-based model, handling token embeddings, positional embeddings, multiple transformer blocks, and output generation.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Initialization (`__init__`):** Initializes embeddings, transformer blocks, and a final linear layer, and applies weight initialization.
  - **Forward Pass (`forward`):** Computes token and positional embeddings, passes through transformer blocks, applies layer normalization, and produces logits. Optionally computes cross-entropy loss if targets are provided.
  - **Text Generation (`generate`):** Generates sequences by predicting tokens one at a time, using softmax probabilities and sampling the next token.
